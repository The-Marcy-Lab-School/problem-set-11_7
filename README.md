# Problem Set: Sorting Algorithms

## Directions
Respond to short response questions in clear, concise sentences directly within this file. Use markdown to ensure that your answers are formatted correctly.

Complete code challenges in `exercises.js`. 

Use Test Driven Development to guide you. Run `npm install` to download dependencies. Run `npm test` to run tests locally. Ensure all tests are passing before submitting this problem set.

### Short Response Questions

1. There are four sorting algorithms listed below. For each one, please provide:

    * A detailed explanation of how the algorithm works
    * The space and time complexity in Big O notation
    * Some cases when you might prefer or not prefer this algorithm over others (i.e. "This algorithm performs well if the list is already nearly sorted")

**Insertion Sort:**

**Bubble Sort:**

**Merge Sort:**

**Quick Sort:**

### Coding Exercises

1. In the `exercises.js` file, implement each of the sorting algorithms above **without using JavaScript's built-in** `Array.prototype.sort()` method. Each of the functions has been stubbed out for you, but you are welcome to create your own helper functions if needed.
