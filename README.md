# Problem Set 11.6 - Graphs

## Directions
Respond to short response questions in clear, concise sentences directly within this file. Use markdown to ensure that your answers are formatted correctly.

### Questions

1. There are four sorting algorithms listed below. For each one, please provide:

    * A detailed explanation of how the algorithm works
    * The space and time complexity in Big O notation
    * Some cases when you might prefer or not prefer this algorithm over others (i.e. "This algorithm performs well if the list is already nearly sorted")

**Insertion Sort**

**Bubble Sort**

**Merge Sort**

**Quick Sort**


2. In the `exercises.js` file, implement each of the sorting algorithms above. Run `jest` to execute the test suite. Each of the functions has been stubbed out for you, but you are welcome to create helper functions if needed.
